# Yelp-Customer-Review-Analysis

This study leverages real Yelp data, SQL, and Google Cloud tools (Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Vertex AI) to analyze customer satisfaction trends and offer actionable insights for restaurant owners. By focusing on factors such as service quality, menu variety, ambiance, pricing, and accessibility, the analysis identifies strategies for improving Yelp ratings and enhancing customer experiences. Additionally, it highlights regional and demographic patterns that can guide targeted marketing and operational improvements.
Yelp reviews showed steady growth from 2005 to 2019, peaking in 2018, before declining sharply in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Elite users play a critical role in shaping trends, contributing nearly 400 reviews on average compared to 34 by non-elite users. These influential users also garner more “useful” votes, fans, and compliments, making them key advocates for businesses. Restaurants should actively engage elite users through personalized interactions and exclusive offers to amplify their reputation and visibility.
Accessibility emerged as a crucial factor, with wheelchair-accessible locations receiving the highest ratings and review counts. This demonstrates the value of inclusivity and high operational standards in driving customer satisfaction. Seasonal peaks in reviews during July, August, and January, and high activity on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, highlight the importance of optimizing service and promotions during these periods. Encouraging detailed positive reviews and spotlighting "cool" or "useful" feedback can further enhance engagement and guide businesses in improving their offerings. By prioritizing quality service, adapting to trends, and fostering strong customer relationships, restaurant owners can build loyalty and maintain a competitive edge in a dynamic dining landscape.
